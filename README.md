## Water Supply Management Program

### Project description
This program was made for DA course unit of Bachelor in Informatics and Computing Engineering at FEUP.
 This program is an analysis tool that can support the Management Team of a water supply network in Portugal to make informed decisions about how to best allocate its resources.
 
### What can this project do?
Choose to import from the original dataset (big or small) or a custom dataset from file paths.

Get information such as:
 - List of all City in the dataset and there respective information;
 - Get the information of a specific City from a given code or name or ID;
 - Get the information of the City that has max or min demand;
 - Get the information of the City that has max or min population;
 - List of all Reservoir in the dataset and there respective information;
 - Get the information of a specific Reservoir from a given code or name or ID or Municipality;
 - Get the information of the Reservoir that has max or min delivery;
 - List of all Station in the dataset and there respective information;
 - Get the statistics of the network such as Average (Capacity - Flow), Max (Capacity - Flow), Variance (Capacity - Flow), current flow to all City and current max flow.
 
Make requests such as:
 - Compute the standard max flow of the network;
 - Compute the max flow of the network but prioritizing specific City given by the user or in order of population;
 - Compute the max flow of the network with overflow;
 - Compute the max flow of the network with overflow that is able to reach a specific City;
 - Compute the max flow of the network with overflow for only a given list of City;
 - Erase specific Reservoir, Station or pipes from the Graph;
 - Balance the flow of the network in order to reduce the Variance (Capacity - Flow).

Change settings such as:
 - Enabling colour mode;
 - Changing the display mode of the network statistics.
